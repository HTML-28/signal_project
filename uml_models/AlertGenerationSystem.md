# Alert Generation System Overview

The Alert Generation System in the CHMS is responsible for real-time monitoring of patient data and notifying medical staff when critical thresholds are exceeded.

## Key Components

- **AlertGenerator**: Evaluates incoming `PatientData` (e.g., heart rate) against patient-specific `Threshold` values. If a threshold is breached, it creates an `Alert` containing the patient ID, issue description, and timestamp.
- **Threshold**: Stores customizable rules for each patient, such as maximum heart rate limits.
- **Alert**: Records alert details, including patient information, the detected issue, and the time of occurrence.
- **AlertManager**: Receives alerts from `AlertGenerator` and dispatches them to medical staff.
- **PatientIdentifier**: Ensures alerts are linked to patient names by interfacing with the patient identification system.
- **PatientData**: Represents a single data point (e.g., heart rate = 135) and connects to the data storage system.

## Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Each class has a single responsibility—data evaluation, alert creation, alert delivery, or patient identification—making the system easy to maintain and extend.
- **Associations**: Classes interact through clear associations (e.g., `AlertGenerator` uses multiple `Threshold` objects).
- **Security**: Sensitive data, such as patient names, is accessed only where necessary to maintain privacy.

This design enables the CHMS to deliver timely and secure alerts, ensuring rapid response to patient health issues.
